    Godzilla, the beastly forse of power, one of many kaijus within the monster verse can. He fire atomic blasts (also known as his atomic breath),can suposivly fly, and is 119.8 meters tall and thats really fricking tall. He of coarse has some weaknesses, wikizilla states how his gills could be a weak spot, but overall this is a fearsome beast.
